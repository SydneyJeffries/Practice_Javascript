// but somehow from the outside I can still change function and even proform it. 
// im going to see if the local object behaves the same way, where i can edit, and call it from the outside of the constructor function

console.log(circle.color)  // the local varriable that we made and  set to a string returned to be undefined. thus was not accessable from outside
console.log(circle) // returns circle object and has the updated x and y values. 
// thus so far 
console.log(circle.color) // i'm calling color now that i've made a closure out of color
console.log(circle.math) // does not return anything. it looks like our varriables set to premative in local scope are not accessable outside the object.
